  <h1>Privacy Policy - Rozzter</h1>
  <p>Effective date: <strong>2025-11-14</strong></p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Rozzter is a lightweight lookup tool for NFL players. The app stores limited preferences and history only on your
    device (e.g., recent searches, your last selected team, and your theme preference). Rozzter does not transmit this
    data to the developer or any third party.</p>

  <h2>What data Rozzter collects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>In‑app search history:</strong> Recent lookup queries you enter (player name or team + jersey number).
      Stored locally on the device only.</li>
    <li><strong>Last selected team:</strong> The most recent team you picked, so the app can reopen with that team
      preselected. Stored locally on the device only.</li>
    <li><strong>Theme preference:</strong> Your light/dark theme choice. Stored locally on the device only.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Rozzter does <em>not</em> collect personal information, contact information, unique device identifiers, precise
    location, or any analytics/advertising data.</p>

  <h2>How we use this data</h2>
  <p>Local data is used only to power in‑app features like the Recents list, remembering your last selected team, and
    your preferred theme. We do not use this data for analytics, advertising, profiling, or sharing with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Storage and security</h2>
  <p>Your recent searches, team preference, and theme setting are stored locally in the app’s storage on your device.
    Rozzter does not upload this information to any server. When Rozzter opens search results or third‑party pages (for
    example, ESPN or Google), it launches your device’s external web browser using HTTPS links; any data collected by
    those sites is governed by their privacy policies, not Rozzter’s.</p>
  <p><strong>Backups:</strong> On Android devices, your system or cloud backup may include Rozzter’s local app data
    (such as recent searches and preferences) associated with your Google account. Backups are managed by your
    device/Google account and are not transmitted to the Rozzter developer.</p>

  <h2>Data deletion</h2>
  <p>You can remove locally stored data at any time:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the app’s <strong>Recent → Clear Recent</strong> control to clear recent searches.</li>
    <li>To remove all local app data (including last selected team and theme), uninstall the app or clear its storage
      via: <em>Device Settings → Apps → Rozzter → Storage → Clear data</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Rozzter has no user accounts and no server-side data; we do not store any data remotely. Because we do not store
    any data remotely, data deletion requests are not applicable.</p>

  <h2>Third‑party websites and content</h2>
  <p>Rozzter constructs and opens HTTPS URLs in your external browser to display search results on third‑party sites
    (for example, ESPN or Google). Rozzter does not embed or scrape third‑party content. Any data those third parties
    collect when you use your browser is subject to their privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>Rozzter is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under 13. The app does not knowingly
    collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For privacy questions or requests, please email <strong>contact@rozziesquare.com</strong></p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy occasionally. The “Effective date” above will be updated when material changes are made.
